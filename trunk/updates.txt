Things to change in next version
1.  Be able to change plotting parameters (text size, etc) in plotting functions
2.  User defined color maps for plotting functions 
3.  Maybe a 3d plotting function?
4.  Maybe a contour plotting function?
5.  Get Jonathan to change evolfft so that you can make it not adjust.
6.  Fix Figure 3 in the EEMD vignette - most of the signal is missing!
7.  Make it possible to change the resolution of hspec without having to
rerender the spectrogram.  Or just see if there's a way to speed up
hhspec_render.
8.  Add marginal spectrum option.
9.  Update hh_render so that it returns separate IMFs.
10.  Make the "pretty" option not screw up the time series by making the end
time longer than it should be. Sometimes it scales a 25 second signal to have
an end time of 26, which causes big problems later 
11.  Make sure 'par' is returned in image renderers where it is changed
12.  Make axes editable
13.  Check out as.image() in the fields package
14.  Make spectrogram able to discretize time.
15.  Check out new stop rule mentioned on page 3 of Huang et al 2013
16.  Add log frequency option.
