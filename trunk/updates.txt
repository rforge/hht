Things to change in next version
1.  Be able to change plotting parameters (text size, etc) in plotting functions
2.  User defined color maps for plotting functions 
3.  Maybe a 3d plotting function?
4.  Maybe a contour plotting function?
5.  Get Jonathan to change evolfft so that you can make it not adjust.
6.  Fix Figure 3 in the EEMD vignette - most of the signal is missing!
7.  Make it possible to change the resolution of hspec without having to
rerender the spectrogram.  Or just see if there's a way to speed up
hhspec_render.
8.  Add marginal spectrum option.
9.  Update hh_render so that it returns separate IMFs.
10.  Make the "pretty" option not screw up the time series by making the end
time longer than it should be. Sometimes it scales a 25 second signal to have
an end time of 26, which causes big problems later 
11.  Make sure 'par' is returned in image renderers where it is changed
12.  Make axes editable
13.  Check out as.image() in the fields package
14.  Make spectrogram able to discretize time.
15.  Check out new stop rule mentioned on page 3 of Huang et al 2013
16.  Add log frequency option.
17.  Make our own instantaneous frequency calculator that uses the central
difference method without having to unravel stuff.
Things that were changed
-updated hhspec_image to return image on request
Items that have been addressed
#1 - can pass a lot of optional parameters
#2 - done
#3 - not really necessary
#4 - not really necessary
#5 - Made my own evolfft
#6 - Done
#7 - Improved hh_render, I think it is slightly faster (possibly at the
expense of hhspec_image)
#8 Done
#9 Done
#10 - Probably needs more testing
#11 - Par has been removed completely
#12 - More or less
#13 - incorporated into hh_render
#14 - Done
#15 - Sent to Donghoh Kim (author of the EMD package) for evaluation.  The
stop rule is not very precise, and I am suspicious.
#16 - Done
#17 - Done

TO DO STILL
-Render "interesting signals", remember to update equation in example 3
-Edit EEMD vignette
